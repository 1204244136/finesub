"""Frame activity -> segments (P11).

The first test is the one that matters: two people talking at once must come out
as two segments. Every published smoothing recipe for this problem is a
single-label state machine, and pressing one onto a 4-sigmoid output silently
hands the overlap to whoever wins -- destroying the one capability this line has
that clustering never did.
