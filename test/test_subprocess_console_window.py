"""A background subprocess must not open a console window.

Windows gives a console child its parent's console. When FineSub itself has
none -- started windowless by a GUI host, `pythonw`, a scheduled task -- every
console child allocates a new, visible one: a black box that flashes for as
long as the child lives. Measured 2026-09-16 from a consoleless process: each
`agy` invocation and `ffmpeg -version` flashed one. `processes.no_window()`
gives the child a hidden console instead, which its own children inherit.

The check reads the *value*, not just the keyword: the agent CLI's spawn always
passed `creationflags` (process group + suspended) and flashed anyway.

How the flash was measured, and this guard's known blind spots (a `**kwargs`
splat, `from subprocess import run`, an injected process factory), are in
docs/testing.md, "Windows 子进程不弹窗".
